Read carefully and follow these:\n\nNowadays models are able to handle vocabularies from multiple languages. If two words have pretty similar meanings in different languages, they might have similar embeddings as well. One follow-up question is, if the words have multiple meanings, and one of the meanings is pretty similar but others are not, will the embedding still be similar?\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: The above instructions from the user have HIGHER PRIORITY than the\ngeneral workflow steps below. If there is any conflict between user instructions\nand the general workflow, ALWAYS follow the user&#39;s instructions.\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\nCRITICAL: Environment Setup\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou MUST use an isolated environment for this project. DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing system environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Check if a virtual environment already exists (the resource finder may have created one):\n\n   If .venv/ directory exists:\n   - Skip to step 3 (activate it)\n   - The pyproject.toml should already exist\n\n   If .venv/ does NOT exist:\n   - Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n     uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file (if not already present):\n   Check: ls pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null || echo \"NEED_PYPROJECT\"\n\n   If pyproject.toml does NOT exist, create it to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nGPU DETECTION AND UTILIZATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nAt the START of your session, check for GPU availability:\n\n1. Run GPU detection:\n   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv 2>/dev/null || echo \"NO_GPU\"\n\n2. If GPUs are available:\n   - Use GPU-accelerated libraries (PyTorch with CUDA, TensorFlow-GPU)\n   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on GPU memory:\n     * 8GB: batch_size=16-32\n     * 16GB: batch_size=32-64\n     * 24GB+: batch_size=64-128\n   - Enable mixed precision training for faster execution:\n     # PyTorch\n     from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler\n     scaler = GradScaler()\n\n     # TensorFlow\n     tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')\n\n3. If NO GPU available:\n   - Use CPU-optimized settings\n   - Reduce model sizes if needed (e.g., use smaller transformer models)\n   - Consider using smaller datasets for feasibility\n\n4. Document GPU usage in REPORT.md:\n   - GPU model and memory\n   - Batch sizes used\n   - Training time comparisons\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:\n\n✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:\n  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models\n  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.\n  - Use actual API calls to test behavior\n  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior\n  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.\n\n✗ DO NOT create \"simulated LLM agents\":\n  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules\n  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior\n  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated\n- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems\n- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)\n- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✓ CORRECT: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Download TruthfulQA dataset\n  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT\n  → Measure actual calibration metrics\n  → Statistical comparison\n\n✗ WRONG: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise\n  → Make up 50 questions\n  → Run simulation\n  → This is NOT research!\n\nIf you find yourself about to create \"simulated LLM agents,\" STOP and use real APIs instead.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nExecute the following research task:\n\n================================================================================\n                    RESEARCH TASK SPECIFICATION\n================================================================================\n\n## RESEARCH TITLE\n\nDo words with similar meanings in different languages have similar embeddings\n\n## RESEARCH DOMAIN\n\nNlp\n\n## HYPOTHESIS / RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nWords with similar meanings in different languages will have similar embeddings in multilingual models. If words have multiple meanings, and only one meaning is similar across languages while others are not, the embeddings may or may not remain similar.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n### User-Provided Instructions and Context:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nowadays models are able to handle vocabularies from multiple languages. If two words have pretty similar meanings in different languages, they might have similar embeddings as well. One follow-up question is, if the words have multiple meanings, and one of the meanings is pretty similar but others are not, will the embedding still be similar? &lt;&lt;&lt;\n\n(Note: Follow any specific instructions above with high priority)\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow. Follow each phase carefully.\n\nIMPORTANT: Resources have been pre-gathered for you!\nCheck your workspace for:\n- literature_review.md: Synthesized literature review\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available resources\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets\n- code/: Cloned repositories and baseline code\n\nUse these resources to inform your experimental design.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                        RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPHASE 0: MOTIVATION &amp; NOVELTY ASSESSMENT (CRITICAL - DO NOT SKIP)\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBefore ANY experimental work, you MUST establish:\n\n1.

Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication &amp; Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen&#39;s kappa, Fleiss&#39; kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent &amp; System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature &gt; 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration &amp; Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(&#34;OPENAI_API_KEY&#34;)\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(&#34;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&#34;))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=&#34;gpt-4&#34;):\n    &#34;&#34;&#34;Robust API calling with exponential backoff.&#34;&#34;&#34;\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2.

If we know how \"meaning\" is preserved or distorted in the embedding space, we can better design models for low-resource languages and improve cross-lingual transfer. Specifically, understanding how polysemy affects these representations helps in disambiguation tasks and in understanding the limitations of shared vector spaces.\n\n### Gap in Existing Work\nMost literature focuses on overall alignment (isomorphism) between languages or Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI) performance. While some work (like Zhang et al. 2019) touches on non-isomorphism, there is less focus on the systematic \"pull\" that non-shared meanings exert on a word's embedding in a multilingual context. We want to quantify how much a secondary, non-shared meaning \"dilutes\" the similarity of a word to its translation in another language.\n\n### Our Novel Contribution\nWe will systematically compare the embedding similarity of monosemous translation pairs versus polysemous pairs where only a subset of meanings are shared. This will provide a \"polysemy penalty\" metric for cross-lingual alignment.\n\n### Experiment Justification\n- **Experiment 1: Baseline Global Alignment**: Establish the expected similarity for \"standard\" translations to provide a control group.\n- **Experiment 2: Polysemy Impact Analysis**: Compare similarity scores for monosemous vs. polysemous words using WordNet (OMW) to define sense counts.\n- **Experiment 3: Case Study on \"False Friends\" and \"Partial Friends\"**: Deep dive into specific word pairs (like English 'bank' vs French 'banque') to see if embeddings cluster more with the shared or non-shared meanings.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Planning\n\n### Research Question\nDo words with similar meanings in different languages have similar embeddings in multilingual models? Specifically, how does polysemy (multiple meanings) affect this similarity when only some meanings are shared?\n\n### Hypothesis Decomposition\n1. **H1 (Similarity)**: Translation pairs for monosemous words will exhibit significantly higher cosine similarity than random word pairs in MLLMs.\n2. **H2 (Polysemy Interference)**: Translation pairs where one or both words are polysemous will have lower similarity than monosemous pairs, proportional to the number of non-shared senses.\n3. **H3 (Dominant Sense)**: The embedding of a polysemous word will be closer to its translation if the shared sense is the \"dominant\" (most frequent) sense in both languages.\n\n### Proposed Methodology\n\n#### Approach\nWe will use a modern multilingual model (e.g., `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` or `xlm-roberta-base`) to extract word embeddings. We will use WordNet (via the OMW sample provided) to categorize words by their polysemy (number of synsets they belong to).\n\n#### Experimental Steps\n1. **Setup**: Initialize environment and load models.\n2. **Data Processing**: \n    - Extract English-French and English-Spanish pairs from MUSE.\n    - Annotate these pairs with \"Sense Count\" from WordNet/OMW.\n    - Identify \"Shared Senses\" vs \"Unique Senses\".\n3. **Similarity Calculation**:\n    - Calculate cosine similarity for all pairs.\n    - Group results by polysemy levels (Monosemous-Monosemous, Monosemous-Polysemous, Polysemous-Polysemous).\n4. **Statistical Analysis**: \n    - Perform T-tests/ANOVA to see if polysemy significantly reduces similarity.\n    - Correlation analysis between (Sense Count) and (Similarity).\n\n### Baselines\n- **Random Pairs**: Similarity between non-translation pairs.\n- **Monosemous Translations**: The \"Gold Standard\" for similarity.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n- **Cosine Similarity**: Primary metric for embedding closeness.\n- **CSLS (Cross-Domain Similarity Local Scaling)**: To account for the \"hubness\" problem in high-dimensional spaces.\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\n- Correlation (Spearman) between total senses and cosine similarity.\n- T-test comparing similarity of Monosemous vs Polysemous pairs.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Successfully quantified the relationship between polysemy and cross-lingual embedding similarity.\n- Identified whether \"partial\" meaning similarity is sufficient for \"high\" embedding similarity.\n"}}

Executive Summary\nThis research investigates the relationship between word meaning similarity and embedding similarity in multilingual large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we address the question: \"If words have multiple meanings, and only one of the meanings is shared across languages, will the embedding still be similar?\"\n\nOur experiments on English-French and English-Spanish pairs using the `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` model reveal that:\n1. **Meaning Alignment**: Translation pairs with shared meanings exhibit high cosine similarity (mean ~0.8), significantly above the random baseline (~0.37).\n2. **Semantic Interference**: Polysemy acts as a \"semantic pull.\" There is a statistically significant negative correlation (Spearman ρ = -0.125, p = 0.010) between the number of non-shared senses and the cosine similarity of the embedding.\n3. **Resilience**: Even with significant non-shared meanings, embeddings remain much closer to their translations than to random words, suggesting that the shared semantic signal remains dominant in the latent space of modern MLLMs.\n\n## 2. Goal\nThe primary goal was to test whether non-shared meanings of polysemous words \"dilute\" their embedding similarity to their translations in other languages. This is crucial for understanding how MLLMs represent concepts and the potential for \"semantic leakage\" or interference in cross-lingual tasks.\n\n## 3. Data Construction\n\n### Dataset Description\n- **MUSE Dictionaries**: Used for English-French (en-fr) and English-Spanish (en-es) translation pairs.\n- **Open Multilingual WordNet (OMW)**: A sample of ~500 synsets with lemmas in multiple languages was used to provide \"ground truth\" for polysemy (sense counts) and sense sharing.\n\n### Data Processing\n1. Pairs were extracted from MUSE.\n2. Only pairs where both words were present in the OMW sample were retained to ensure reliable polysemy data.\n3. Identical word spellings (e.g., 'article' in EN and FR) were excluded for the primary correlation analysis to prevent lexical overlap from confounding the semantic similarity measure.\n4. Total processed non-identical pairs: 423.\n\n### Metrics\n- **Cosine Similarity**: Measured between word embeddings.\n- **Non-shared Senses (NS)**: Defined as `(en_senses + target_senses) - (2 * shared_senses)`.\n- **Spearman Correlation**: Used to measure the relationship between NS and similarity.\n\n## 4. Experiment Description\n\n### Methodology\nWe used `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` as a representative modern MLLM. We categorized word pairs into:\n- **Monosemous-Shared**: Both words have exactly one sense, which is shared.\n- **Polysemous-Full**: Both words have multiple senses, and ALL are shared.\n- **Polysemous-Partial**: Words have one or more senses that are NOT shared.\n\n### Results Summary\n\n| Category | Mean Similarity | Std Dev | Count |\n|----------|-----------------|---------|-------|\n| Monosemous-Shared | 0.817 | 0.190 | 214 |\n| Polysemous-Full | 0.892 | 0.109 | 10 |\n| Polysemous-Partial | 0.794 | 0.177 | 49 |\n| **Random Baseline** | 0.370 | 0.122 | 273 |\n\n*Note: These stats are from the initial EN-FR run. Combined results showed similar trends.*\n\n## 5. Result Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n1. **Significant Negative Correlation**: In the combined dataset (n=423), the correlation between non-shared senses and similarity was **-0.125 (p=0.010)**. This confirms that extra, non-shared meanings pull the embedding away from its translation.\n2. **Language Variance**: The effect was notably stronger in English-Spanish (**ρ = -0.205, p = 0.003**) than in English-French (**ρ = -0.096, p = 0.155**). This suggests that some languages may have more \"conflicting\" polysemy structures or the model is differently sensitive to them.\n3. **High Baseline Similarity**: Even for words with 3+ non-shared senses, the similarity rarely dropped below 0.4-0.5, remaining far above the random baseline (~0.37). This indicates that MLLMs are robust at preserving the shared semantic signal.\n\n### Case Studies\n- **'shot' (EN) vs 'coup' (FR)**: 3 non-shared senses. Similarity = **0.409**. (Low similarity due to distinct polysemy: 'shot' as a photo/attempt vs 'coup' as a blow/stroke).\n- **'substance' (EN) vs 'substance' (FR)**: Similarity = **1.0**. (Identical tokens are typically mapped to the same vector regardless of meaning divergence).\n\n## 6. Conclusions\nOur research confirms that words with similar meanings in different languages have similar embeddings, but this similarity is attenuated by polysemy. Non-shared meanings exert a measurable \"interference\" effect, reducing the alignment of the word vectors. However, the shared sense usually remains the dominant feature, keeping the vectors closer to each other than to unrelated words.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1. **Contextual Embeddings**: Extend this research to contextualized embeddings (ELMo/BERT) to see if context successfully \"prunes\" the non-shared meanings and restores full similarity.\n2. **Larger Scale**: Use a full WordNet dataset instead of the OMW sample to increase the sample size for more languages.\n3. **Causal Analysis**: Probe the embeddings to see if specific dimensions represent the non-shared meanings.\n","file_path":"REPORT.md"}}
