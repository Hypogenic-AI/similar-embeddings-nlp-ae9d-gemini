We investigated the impact of polysemy on cross-lingual word embedding alignment. By analyzing 423 translation pairs across English, French, and Spanish, we quantified a ``semantic interference'' effect: non-shared meanings systematically reduce the similarity between translations ($ho = -0.125$). However, we also found that this effect is bounded; modern MLLMs maintain robust alignment even in the face of ambiguity, suggesting a dominant shared conceptual core. These findings provide a granular view of the limits of implicit alignment and highlight the need for context-aware mechanisms in cross-lingual transfer.
